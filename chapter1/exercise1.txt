Exercise:
Give another possible calculation for the result of double (double 2).

double (double 2)
=   {applying the outer double}
double 2 + double 2
=   {applying the first double}
(2 + 2) + double 2
=   {applying double}
(2 + 2) + (2 + 2)
=   {applying the first +}
4 + (2 + 2)
=   {applying the second +}
4 + 4
=   {applying +}
