Exercise:
How should the definition of the function qsort be modified so that it pro-
duces a reverse sorted version of a list?

qsort []        = []
qsort (x:xs)    = qsort larger ++ [x] ++ qsort smaller
                  where
                    larger  = [a | a <- xs, a >= x]
                    smaller = [b | b <- xs, b < x]
