Exercise:
Define a function product that produces the product of a list of numbers,
and show using your definition that product [2,3,4] = 24.

product []      = 1
product (n:ns)  = n * product ns

product [2,3,4]
=   {applying product}
2 * product [3,4]
=   {applying product}
2 * (3 * product [4])
=   {applying product}
2 * (3 * (4 * product []))
=   {applying product}
2 * (3 * (4 * 1))
=   {applying third *}
2 * (3 * 4)
=   {applying second *}
2 * 12
=   {applying *}
24
