# Programming in Haskell 2nd Edition solutions
This repository contains my solution to the exercisees in
Graham Hutton's book "Programming In Haskell 2nd Edition". 
I will continue working on this repository until it is
finished.

Currently, the repository holds the solutions for chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.

DISCLAIMER: I am a CS student myself and do not have the
official solutions myself. Exercises which contain an answer
in the book are checked for correctness. However, solutions
may still differ from the solutions in the book, so long as
they are still correct.
