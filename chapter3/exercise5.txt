Exercise:
Why is it not feasible in general for function types to be instances of the Eq
class? When is it feasible? Hint: two functions of the same type are equal if
they always return equal results for equal arguments.

It is generally not feasible for function types to be instances of the Eq class
because functions generally take arguments that are of types which can have
a very large amount of different elements. 

Take two functions which take one argument belonging to the Int class (which 
takes numbers from -2^64 to 2^64 - 1). To test if these functions are equal,
you would have to go through each individual number and test if the output
is the same. This is generally infeasible due to the amount of time it will
take.

For smaller types, like Bool and maybe even Char, this would be feasible. Bool
for example can only take on two values: True and False. It does not take too
much time to compare the inputs and outputs of two functions that take Bool
arguments.
